    a)  encapsulation+consice!!! -> each mehtod function do not exceed 30lines of code, excluding comments. 
    b) decoupling -> utils.js created, very good!
    c) Readable+maintainable: Finished.returnFinished() has double for loop, (I used filter and some at the begining) but really hard to change in future!
    d) asked fewer questions to the ChatGPT: 
        -. only 4 questions: 
    e) finished new feature and worked in 2.5 hours(excluding summary):

        1) how to change an object to array? I used `Array.from(obj)`;
        2) how to get object attribue value? turns out I was correct at concept but wrong for typo.
        3) parent.appendChild js? learned that naming should add element, after you created element!
        4) how to create a div element and adding class value at the same time? You have to do it in two steps, 1)create; 2)classList.add()

b) add a % in logs; 
c) add rules of writing, so writers can use them! e.g. 1.2.3. / (1,2,3a) / .,.
below are optional
c) add last time wrongs in tag quiz.
d) when loading adding a circling thing.
